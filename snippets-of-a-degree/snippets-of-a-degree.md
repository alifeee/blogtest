# Snippets of a Degree - random sentences from random Masters' projects

<word-count parent=".markdown-body"></word-count>

I did a [Physics degree at Durham University](https://alifeee.co.uk/durham_physics/). This blog comes as a result of a party I had just before final year exams, after everyone had finished their final-year dissertations and reports.

To celebrate that we'd all spent half the year knee-deep inside a PDF, we had DICE (Dissertation Isdone Celebration Event)! As part of the party, I got people to write down a sentence or phrase from their dissertation, without context. We drew them out of a hat and made a game of guessing what the degree title was for each.

Recently I was reminded of the party when I pulled what remained of the notes from the bottom of a deep drawer. I thought that it would be nice to digitise them, so they're viewable, as I think that it's quite artistic that each note represents a sort of "summary" of someone's entire degree.

They were each numbered, but unfortunately, I didn't find the key which matched the number to the writer or degree title. But... that just means that *you* get to play the game of guessing what degree each belongs to!

(p.s., after the [previous post](../sketch-your-society/), it seems as if I've turned this blog into [found paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/foundpaper). the next post won't be. maybe.)

## The snippets

The labelling suggests there were at least 15 snippets, but number 10 is AWOL. Thus, here are only 14. To see the degree for each sentence, check the [answers](./answers.txt) (these will be updated as I remember them or as the people who wrote them read this...)

Unfortunately, during the testing, one of the participants (a male aged 18-24) had to stop the process after only a couple of minutes due to sickness, and therefore did not have change to generate any meaningful data for this project.
