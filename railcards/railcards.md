# The difference between a 16-25 and 26-30 railcard

<word-count parent=".markdown-body"></word-count>

Welcome to a semi deep dive on UK Railcards.

This is inspired from the string of questions and answers of:

<!-- omit in toc -->
## When can you stop using a 16-25 railcard?

You can buy a 1-year 16-25 railcard up to the day before you turn 26, so you can use one up to the day before you turn 27.

...or "until you are 27".

<!-- omit in toc -->
## So, should you try to eke it out?

Well, there is a 26-30 Railcard. So, it's pointless trying to game any systems if they are functionally the same.

(spoilers: probably not)

<!-- omit in toc -->
## Are the 16-25 and 26-30 railcards functionally the same?

What a good question! Let's find out. We will be lamenting the difference between the railcard websites, lamenting the difference between the Terms & Conditions, and lamenting the lack of a universal Railcard.

## What railcards can you buy?

The [Railcards website][railcards] has a list of all railcards that you can buy. To save you a click, the ones listed there are:

- [16-17 Saver][railcards#16-17]
- [16-25 Railcard][railcards#16-25]
- [26-30 Railcard][railcards#26-30]
- [Disabled Persons Railcard][railcards#disabled]
- [Family & Friends Railcard][railcards#:family]
- [Network Railcard][railcards#network]
- [Senior Railcard][railcards#senior]
- [Two Together Railcard][railcards#twotogether]
- [Veterans Railcard][railcards#veterans]

### All the railcard sites are different

All the websites above are different. They are all about railcards, which are broadly "cards that get you 1/3 off train ticket costs", but each is a completely different website. This means that to compare two cards (as we do below), the link structure and information on each of the pages is completely different. This is kind of annoying.

### What railcard can you buy: Flow chart

I had a look at the eligibility criteria for the railcards, and drew up a flow chart to decide if anyone could buy one or not.

In short: you can probably buy one. However, if you are:

- between 31 and 59 years old
- not living in the South-East of England
- not travelling with another person

...then you probably can't buy one.

I made the flowchart using [tldraw]. Here it is. It contains two railcards not in the URL above: the armed forces railcard and the local railcard, which are listed on the [Wikipedia page for "Concessionary fares on the British railway network"][wikipedia#railcards]. That page doesn't have all the railcards listed, so maybe I should edit it...

Anyway, flowchart:

I have also turned the flowchart into one made using [Mermaid], which is a way of making diagrams with text (or "code", but that is a scary word). Here is a snippet of the source, and the chart below (rendered by *your* browser!).

### The Britrail pass

As a sidenote, I discovered this week about the existence of the [Britrail pass][britrail], which is a rail pass similar to the [Interrail pass][interrail] but just for the UK. It seems a similar price, so could be useful if you want to go on a train adventure in the UK, but you have a UK passport (as Interrail prohibits use in your home country).

### The BahnCard

There is a lot of information in the above flowcharts. In Germany, the flow chart for their [BahnCard][BahnCard] is much simpler, and I can write it as the text:

If you are:

- 6-26 years old: you can get a "My BahnCard"
- 27-64 years old: you can get a BahnCard
- older than 65: you can get a BahnCard for senior citizens

![screenshot of BahnCard and My BahnCard](images/bahncard_all.png)

<figcaption>

All the BahnCards available (well, there is also a more expensive 50% off version, a trial version, and the senior citizen version is not shown here)

</figcaption>

Currently, you can also buy a "Fan BahnCard", which gets better if Germany wins the current UEFA EURO football competition. No-loss gambling, I suppose?

![Screenshot of BahnCard website, with cards that say "Fan BahnCard 25, 2nd class. Save 3 months and extend for free for 12 months if Germany wins UEFA EURO 2024™"](images/bahncard_uefa.png)

This leads on to:

### A national railcard?

The existence of a national railcard would nullify this entire blog post. I'd welcome that.

Quoting my good friend, and reliable source, [Wikipedia][wikipedia#nationalrailcard]:

> Railfuture [...] has been campaigning [...] for a National Railcard to replace the plethora of different railcards. [...]
>
> A study undertaken jointly by Railfuture and the Rail Passengers Council [...] suggested that three million people would buy such a Railcard for £20.00 if it gave a one third discount on off-peak fares.
>
> The "most conservative forecast" indicated that [...] passenger mileage would be increased by 11% per annum and rail industry profits by £50 million.
>
> The profit-maximising combination [...] would increase profits by £70 million.

i.e., a National Railcard would be pretty sweet. We'll see how that goes, considering that study was from 2003.

## What's the difference between the 16-25 and 26-30 railcard?

As I said before, the websites for the [16-25 Railcard][railcards#16-25] and the [26-30 Railcard][railcards#26-30] are annoyingly different, for how similar concepts they are.

Here is a sub-menu from the 16-25 railcard...

![Screenshot of website sub-menu, showing "About the Railcard", "Benefits", "Are you eligible?", "Using your railcard", "Where to buy", "Renew or Replace", and "Journey Planner"](./images/website_16-25.png)

...and here is the "same" sub-menu from the 26-30 railcard.

![Screenshot of website sub-menu, showing "About the Railcard", "What it is", "Are you eligible", "Travel times & tickets", "Where to buy", "Journey planner", "Renewing your Railcard"](./images/website_26-30.png)

Which of those menu items are you pressing if you want to answer the questions "How old can I be to buy the card?" or "What specific trains can I get?"? It's annoying. It doesn't matter now though, because I found links to the...

### The Terms and conditions

The 16-25 and 26-30 railcards have Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) online:

- [16-25 Railcard Terms and Conditions][tnc#16-25]
- [26-30 Railcard Terms and Conditions][tnc#26-30]

Even these are weirdly different to each other, in formatting and content. I have copied their text and provide the text versions here

- [16-25 Railcard Terms and Conditions (text)](./16-25%20Railcard%20Terms%20&%20Conditions.txt)
- [26-30 Railcard Terms and Conditions (text)](./26-30%20Railcard%20Terms%20&%20Conditions.txt)

I used the diff/compare feature of VSCodium to try and spot the differences between these two texts. But, what I did first was clean them up. They were differently formatted. Here are some differences (I leave it up to you to match each difference to each T&Cs).

- one had spaces at the end of most lines, the other did not
- one used "Data Protection", the other "data protection"
- one used `“”`, the other `''`
- one had a lot of non-breaking spaces `&nbsp;` instead of spaces
- one used "property rights", the other "proporty rights" (bad spelling)

Here are the updated versions after I made the T&Cs more similar to each other in structure:

- [16-25 Railcard Terms and Conditions (text, updated)](./16-25%20Railcard%20Terms%20&%20Conditions_updated.txt)
- [26-30 Railcard Terms and Conditions (text, updated)](./26-30%20Railcard%20Terms%20&%20Conditions_updated.txt)

It should now be more easy to see the differences between them. We can generate a nice diff between these files, using `git diff` like

```bash
git diff --no-index --word-diff=plain -U2 railcard16-25.txt railcard26-30.txt
```

...where `--no-index` enables diffing of files, `--word-diff=plain` diffs words instead of lines, and `-U2` shows 2 lines of context around each diff. The output of this diff is [here](./diff.txt), but I can also turn it into nice-looking HTML by using trickery.

The trickery I used is VSCode's regex find-and-replace to turn `git diff` into more style-able HTML. I followed my own instructions:

- find `\[-(.*?)-\]`, replace `<del>$1</del>`
- find `\{\+(.*?)\+\}`, replace `<ins>$1</ins>` (turns out if you don't escape the second `+` like `\+` you can crash VSCode...)
- find `^(@@.*@@.*)$` replace `<span class="jump">$1</span>`
- wrap header in HTML

Here are the differing parts of the T&Cs!

### All the differences between the 16-25 and 26-30 railcard

The differences are... not much! Here are all of them I know:

- The 26-30 Railcard is only available digitally, while the 16-25 Railcard is available as a physical card (from T&Cs above)
- The 26-30 Railcard does not offer an exemption to non-advance*, on-peak** tickets under £12 in July and August, while the 16-25 Railcard does*** (from T&Cs above)
- The 26-30 Railcard cannot be used for a discount on the Caledonian Sleeper, while the 16-25 Railcard can be****

*: an "advance ticket" as used here means a ticket for a specific train, which can only be used for that train  
**: "on-peak" as used here means trains departing between 04:30am and 10:00am on Monday to Friday, not including public holidays  
***: To clarify: neither railcard can be used to discount non-advance, on-peak tickets under £12. But, the 16-25 railcard does not have this restriction in July and August  
****: Relevant information on the Caledonian Sleeper for the [16-25 Railcard](https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/about-the-railcard/using-your-railcard/) and the [26-30 Railcard](https://www.26-30railcard.co.uk/using-your-railcard/travel-times-tickets/)

### When can you use the 16-25 or 26-30 railcards until?

Another interesting rule we can take from the T&Cs is the latest time you can buy a Railcard, and the latest you can use it. These times are:

- you can buy the 16-25 Railcard until the day you turn 26
- you can use the 16-25 Railcard until the day you turn 27
- you can buy the 26-30 Railcard until the day you turn 31
- you can use the 26-30 Railcard until the day you turn 32

### Use your railcard on the London Underground

I'm not the biggest fan of London. But, one solace is that I get 1/3 off the London Underground with a railcard. You, too, can get this, if you get an Oyster pay-as-you-go card and register the railcard onto it.

## Conclusion

I have provided what is probably too much information about railcards. I hope you enjoy it.

The takeaway is probably: try to buy your railcards near to your birthday.

At the least, hopefully this can save you some money for around 6-12 months if you are 30 years old and your railcard expires soon.

Oh, and: take the Caledonian Sleeper before it's too late.
